### man

man page contains so much information about the commands that you want to look at sometimes it's almost too much.
Most of the time when I need to learn a command quickly I use the man <command>. It gives a very quick overview of command.
Another command which is tldr, this is not a substitute for man, but a handy tool to avoid using yourself in the huge amount of information
present in a man page.
Ex: man ls
You can use the man page to explore all the different options and parameters you can see on a command.
